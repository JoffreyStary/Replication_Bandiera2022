# Replication_Bandiera2022
Critical replication code by Edem Egnikpo, Mathilde Esposito & Joffrey Stary for Bandiera et al (2022)

We propose a critical replication of a scientific article (Bandiera et al. 2022). 
Our replication is based on data provided by the authors, as of 21 February 2023.
This replication took place in the framework of an academic project (Master 2 Economics - ETE track) of Methodology aiming at the critical replication of a scientific article.

On request, we can provide the replication report containing the elements replicated by this code and a research proposal based on a literature review.

We thank the authors of the original article for the transparent access to their data and code.
